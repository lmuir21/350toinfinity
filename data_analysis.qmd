We examined how economic and educational growth unfolded across the 15 most populous countries from 2000 to 2022. Our analysis combined descriptive trends, growth metrics, and quadrant-based classifications to assess whether countries are "growing smarter" or "just richer." We have chosen to show certain visualizations types for only a select number of countries in our 15-country sample to provide clear and focused insights. To avoid overwhelming readers, we have highlighted a subset to represent diverse economic and educational trends. These selected countries illustrate key patterns, outliers, and contrasts, allowing us to tell a compelling story while maintaining clarity and avoiding redundancy.

## 1. Trends in GDP and Education Enrollment

For each country, we visualized:

- **GDP per capita** trends over time (with trendlines).
- **Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Enrollment** rates over time.

## 2. Construction of Education Progress Index (EPI)

We conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on scaled enrollment indicators to produce a single Education Progress Index (EPI) score for each country-year.

The EPI captures general educational improvement across all three levels (primary, secondary, tertiary).

## 3. Growth Metrics: GDP vs. EPI

We calculated two growth measures:

- **GDP per Capita CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: Measures average annual GDP growth.
- **Total EPI Change**: Measures improvement in the composite education index over time.

Countries were classified into quadrants based on their growth patterns:

| Quadrant               | Description                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Smart + Rich           | GDP and EPI both increased              |
| Rich but Not Smarter   | GDP increased but EPI stagnated/declined|
| Smarter but Poorer     | EPI increased despite GDP stagnation    |
| Losing on Both Fronts  | Both GDP and EPI declined               |

![GDP Growth vs. Education Progress (Quadrant Classification)](figures\gdp_vs_epi_quadrants_colored.png)

12 out of 15 countries fell into the "Smart + Rich" quadrant.

3 countries were classified as "Rich but Not Smarter."

## 4. Correlation Between Economic Growth and Education Levels

We investigated the relationship between GDP per capita and enrollment rates:

![Scatterplots of GDP per capita vs Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Enrollment](figures\gdp_vs_education_correlations.png)

- Weak correlation for primary education (r ≈ 0.13).
- Moderate correlation for secondary education (r ≈ 0.50).
- Strong correlation for tertiary education (r ≈ 0.71).

Higher GDP countries tend to have higher tertiary enrollment rates, highlighting tertiary education as a key differentiator.

## 5. Geographic and Group Comparisons

We produced additional insights through:

- Barplots of top 5 countries by GDP growth vs education progress.
- Pie chart summarizing distribution of countries by quadrant.

![Top 5 richest vs. top 5 smartest barplots](figures\top5_smart_vs_rich.png)

![Pie chart of Quadrant Distribution](figures\quadrant_pie_chart.png)

These visualizations demonstrate regional disparities and highlight the divergence between economic and human capital development.

## 6. Focused Analysis by Quadrant

We further analyzed GDP-education correlations separately for "Smart + Rich" and "Rich but Not Smarter" countries:

"Smart + Rich" countries show stronger and more consistent positive correlations, especially at tertiary levels.
